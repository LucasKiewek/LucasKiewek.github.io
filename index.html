      <p>Hey, welcome to <strong>Lucas'</strong> (aka magicburrito) section of <a id="clevOpsLink"href="http://clevops.com">clevOps</a>. In this website you will find a few things, this welcoming paragraph, some stuff about myself, my GitHub, and a way to contact me. The about section talks a little bit about my background in coding and my goals for the future. The GitHub section links you to my GitHub and talks about some of the things I have done there. Finally, the contact section gives you a way to contact me. Prepare to get snazzy...</p>

      <h3 id="about">About:</h3>
      <h4 id="coding">Coding</h4>
      <p>I started coding when I was twelve and became proficient in scratch, but I quickly moved on to my first real programming language, JavaScript. During this time I also learned html and css. I stopped coding for a little while but picked it back up in the summer of 2016 when I learned my main language Python. I later brushed up on html and css and also spent some time learning swift. Finally, I made a <a href="https://github.com/LucasKiewek">GitHub</a> account and took a computer science course in the ninth grade. Today, I can confidently code in swift, Python2 and Python3, html, and css.</p>

      <h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>
      <p>I want to be a project leader at <a href="https://www.tesla.com">Tesla Motors</a>. I love cars and the tesla is arguably the best one, working for a company with a forward thinking goal and an unmatchable product would be an amazing experience. They are consistantly able to surpass expectations and deliver inovative and powerful cars to the world.</p>

      <h4 id="hobbies">Other Hobbies</h4>
      <p>I have been doing flips since I was four and have now progressed further than I had ever imagined. I also enjoy traveling to other countries and observing their culture. I also enjoy watching <a href="http://www.piedpiper.com">Silicon Valley</a> and Tv shows of that ilk. One of my other, more implicit hobbies is learning things by watching educational <a href="https://www.youtube.com">videos</a> or documentaries. I don't know why I enjoy this so much but I learn a lot and have fun while doing so.</p>

      <h4 id="feats">Feats</h4>
      <p>I entered the 2016 breakthrough junior challenge:</p>
