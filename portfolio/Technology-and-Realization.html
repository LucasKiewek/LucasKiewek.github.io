              <h2>Technology and Realization</h2>
              <p>
                During the Creative Electronics course, I familiarized myself with Electrical components and types of circuits, how they work, and how to implement them. My biggest moment of realization was during the heating system project when I got a grasp of both how transistors and amplifiers work, and how I can use them in conjunction to achieve a desired outcome.
                <br><br>
                During Creative Programming, I learned how to use a circuit as input for a processing program. It was interesting to use more abstract forms of input such as pressure or light intensity to control abstract ideas such as the navigation of a fractal. My goal was to use them to help the user get a better feel for the fractal via subtle analogies. For example, the pressure applied to the piezo sensor controlling how deep the user dives into the fractal is analogous to the pressure felt when diving deeper underwater. Similarly, the light exposure to the light-dependent resistor would ‘illuminate’ the fractal by changing the detail to which the fractal was calculated, thus showing more intricate details.
                <br><br>
                During Project 1, My team and I created prototypes which implemented shape memory alloy (SMA) into fabrics and meshes. The Lotus petal prototypes functioned like sensors as they reacted when exposed to a minimum temperature. I conducted a test on the petal prototypes to find the optimal angle between embedded SMA wires for which they would maximally expand the mesh. The knowledge gained from this test and others conducted by my team were later used to realize a final prototype which showcased new methods for controlling mesh with SMAs and advancements in integrating shape memory alloys into fabrics.
