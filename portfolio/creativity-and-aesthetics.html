              <h2>Creativity and Aesthetics</h2>
              <p>
                In From Idea to Design (FI2D), I learned about brainstorming principles and methods such as 6-3-5 Brainwriting.
                My team applied these to have insightful and effective brainstorming sessions.
                I found that the value of these sessions came from the conversations that came up due to the brainstorming and
                not necessarily the content of the brainstorm itself. The techniques learned served as a tool to enter a creative
                problem solving headspace with each other. The majority of my past design projects have been conceptualized and
                executed without a team. FI2D filled my toolbox with skills to leverage the creativity of others for a better
                final design, skills which I used later during Project 1.
                <br><br>
                During Project 1, I did a quick and dirty prototyping workshop with my team. This workshop taught me to use physical prototyping to generate new ideas rather than evaluating concepts that had already been thought about. Later in the design process, a new method of reshaping a nitinol embedded mesh was discovered via prototyping rather than brainstorming. Before beginning my studies at the TU/e, I had limited access to prototyping spaces and materials, this restricted my creative process to heavily rely on brainstorming. By regularly exploring prototyping techniques and spaces during project 1, I enhanced my creative flow through prototyping such that I no longer exclusively rely on brainstorming.
                <br><br>
                Exploratory Sketching (ES) allowed me to develop hard skills such as sketching in perspective, drawing smooth and confident lines, and producing communicative renders. When asked to participate in a user test for the “Complete the Design” Project, I was able to sketch a design using techniques learned in ES. Had I participated in this user test before ES, the sketch would likely lack an understanding of perspective, lack contour lines for complex surfaces, have unconfident and hairy lines, and would have taken me significantly longer to produce.
