              Having moved countries every four years, I learned to adapt to unfamiliar languages, cultures, and ideas. Like Design, I am not static. I seek and thrive on change and adversity. Unfortunately, this means that I suffer under comfort and stagnation. I believe the same is true about design. When I design, I impart great effort on ensuring that ideas are not static. I am quick to discard ideas that are conventional or uninspired. My design philosophy drives me to find creative solutions by challenging the question, the status–quo, or the framework to find a deeper issue.
              <br><br>
              I am more afraid of ‘succeeding’ adequately than failing spectacularly. I am a risk taker. I have and will continue to put myself in situations which I am not prepared to undertake because I experience the most growth when in a state of discomfort. It is why I moved to the Netherlands, it is why I am doing an honors track and calculus tutoring, and it is why I am a designer. My professional identity can be summed up in one word: Adventurous.

            <p style="padding: 20px 80px 0px 0px; text-align: left;">
              When doing an internship for Cocoa Press, a chocolate 3D printer start-up, I was tasked with operating the chocolate 3D printer prototype, creating the models it would print, and manufacturing vacuum formed packaging. The printer prototype was in its earliest stages of development and did not have dedicated temperature controls. Because chocolate needs to be at a specific temperature for specific conditions to create a successful print, I would adjust the current and voltage supplied to the printer depending on room temperature, humidity, and other factors. Issues and failures occurred often, so I collected data on every print, noting the factors above as well as the quality of the produced print to make hypotheses and test them until the issue was fixed. I had no previous experience with chocolate chemistry and had only a very rudimentary understanding of voltage and current, but the steep learning curve before me was more enjoyable than it was daunting.

            <p style="padding: 20px 80px; text-align: left;">
              When I got an idea for an app that would empower athletes of my sport, martial arts tricking, to rediscover tricking after having lost motivation or interest. I taught myself to code in Dart and use the Flutter framework to develop iOS and Android apps because if I wanted the app to exist, I would have to make it. I spent months of my summer developing combination generation algorithms and creating a functional user interface to interact with those algorithms. I would spend days stuck on a single problem, learning how to approach it from unconventional angles until I found a workable solution. One such problem was a UI element that would refuse to blur the background when selected. I solved this problem two days later when I created a way to adapt a piece of an unrelated UI element to the current element. This project taught me how to use perseverance and creativity to get results.

              Later that summer, I did an internship at Gradient.io, a quickly growing tech startup with eight employees at the time. Gradient.io uses machine learning to help Amazon sellers analyze their products as well as other related products to better position themselves on the “digital shelf.” I was tasked with designing and building a browser extension that would bring their service onto the Amazon page itself rather than showing it on their own website. I had no experience building browser extensions, but I love creating solutions. I researched and learned about good web design, taught myself how to create browser extensions, and worked closely with the Senior Frontend Developer at the time to learn how to integrate the extension with Gradient.io’s technology. I was often out of my depth, but I am not afraid to ask questions, so I asked my way out. The gradient.io extension I designed is available on the Chrome Web Store.

            <p style="padding: 20px 80px; text-align: left;">
              During the summer, I have plans of doing an internship I was offered with Ebusco, an electric, composite material bus company. In the next academic year, I plan on focusing on internalizing the undertaking of a rigorous design process while also experimenting with different methods that can be used within that design process.
              <br><br>
              Furthermore, I will be doing an Honors track in the Health and Well-being squad and applied to follow Project 2 in the My Futures squad as it aligns with my vision of thinking in terms of tomorrow rather than today. After university, I plan on doing a masters in Industrial Design in Milan, Italy. After learning Dutch and being immersed in Dutch culture, I must launch myself once more into a state of discomfort and learn Italian.

            <p style="padding: 20px 80px 0px 0px; text-align: left;">
                I want to learn 2 design methods which I have never used before by the end of the next academic year and put them into practice by doing research on a design method I find interesting before both the Honors track and Project 2 and documenting my process of applying that method for one sprint or the entire project depending on the design method.
                <br><br>
                I want to learn to design effectively for people who are nothing like me by conducting structured user research and testing based directly on principles learned in previous courses such as User Centered Design.
